This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project based on the popular word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). It is hosted on [Vercel](https://bday-wordle.vercel.app) for anyone to try out!

## Composition

BDay Wordle has a built out custom component that emulates the behaviour of Wordle for any given word regardless of its length.
This component is then used to create a series of puzzles spelling out "Happy Birthday" as a simple birthday gift ðŸ˜„

## Local Deployment

To deploy a version of BDay Wordle for yourself, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) will show you the BDay Wordle initial puzzle.
